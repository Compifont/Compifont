KBH Real and Swelling Choirs by lfz

EDITED: Now the note range goes from C3 to C7

Originally I heard the choir soundfont in this video and wanted it, but couldn't find it anywhere. This soundfont is something that I found (with no sign of author or any metadata) in a forum thread with a collection of orchestral sounds and edited it to create a similar sound of voices swelling in volume.

You'll find voice aahs and oohs, a mix of both slow and immediate attack versions of the sounds. See the demo included below for a taste of the sound.
